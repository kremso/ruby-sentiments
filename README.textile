h1. Ruby Sentiments

This series of presentations is here to show how much solution of a simple task programmed by diverse developers will differ. The real fun comes, when the original task has to be extended or ... changed a lot :).

h2. Rules
# Ruby programmers (yes, this is Ruby only) concurrently work on 1 specification from the area of web development. 
# They push their solution from current round to this repo.
# At the next Ruby meeting, they present their code for other devs. WHY such a code was written is very important, not just HOW it works.

h3. Round 1:
* User can see list of events (name, description, date, from time, to time).
* User can sign to attend any of those events. 
* User can visit this page later and still see his attendance.

h3. Round 2
* User can sign off an event.
* Events can have limited space. It this limit gets reached, users cant sign to such limited event.
* Admin (a special kind of user) can see emails of all users signed to a particular event.

h3. Round 3
# Two types of events: one-off (with a fixed date) and regular (day in week).
# Users can sign at least one day before the event.

In this repo, you can see results or all rounds. One directory per developer, directory's Readme worth reading.
